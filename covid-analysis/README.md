# COVID-19 Data Analysis & Visualization

This project demonstrates a very basic beginner-level exploration and visualization of global COVID-19 data using Python to understand trends, patterns, and the overall impact of the pandemic. The focus is on **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** and **interactive visual analytics** to make complex data easier to interpret.

## 🔍 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to analyze COVID-19 outbreak data and create high-quality visualizations that highlight:

- Trends in confirmed cases, recoveries, and deaths  
- Country-wise and time-based comparisons  
- Geographic spread of COVID-19 across the world  

This project demonstrates how data science and visualization techniques can be used to extract insights from real-world public datasets.
